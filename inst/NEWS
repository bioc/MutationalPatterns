MutationalPatterns v2.0.0 (Release date: 2019-12-26)
=====================================================

Changes:

* New features & parameter changes:
  + Analyses for double base substitutions and indels are
    now possible. This new feature affects almost all functions.
    Mutation type selection is done by the 'type' argument in a function.
    For functions which return a matrix, selecting multiple mutation
    types will result in a list of matrices. For each mutation
    type a matrix. Functions without 'type' argument also works for other
    mutation types than snvs.
  + Combined signature extraction with 'method' argument in
    'extract_signatures'. Merged counts matrices of multiple
    mutation types are used as input for NMF.
  + New method to refit signatures added. Refit by solving a golden
    ratio search from package deconstructSigs is implemented and
    optional with 'method = golden-ratio-search' in 'fit_to_signatures'.
    Also option added for signature selection based on contribution by
    using the 'cutoff' argument.
  + Combined mutation types counting. All types in one matrix with
    argument 'method = "combine"' in 'mut_matrix'.
  + Relative and absolute contribution plots in same grid for
    'plot_contribution' with argument 'mode = "both"'. Also option
    to plot signature contribution of all mutation types in one figure.
  + Clustering contribution heatmap by mutation type. Cluster mutation
    type will be shown as first type.
  + For rainfall plots, mutation types can be plotted in one figure, or
    in multiple figures in one grid with argument 'method'.
  + 'Colors' argument in 'plot_signature_strand_bias' to give color
    palette for mutation types.

* New functions:
  + check_mutation_type:
    - Check the spelling of the user defined mutation types.
  + cosmic_indel_context:
    - Helper function of 'extract_indels' to transform indel information
    into context from COSMIC.
  + default_colors_ggplot:
    - Get the default colors used in ggplot
  + extract_indels:
    - Extract indels with genomic context out of vcf files and transform
    genomic context to predefined contexts.
  + facet_nested:
    - Helper function for ggplot to plot the indel mutation profile
  + get_contexts_indel:
    - Helper function of 'extract_indels' to get information about indels
    from vcf file.
  + golden_ratio_search_fitting:
    - Wrapper function around deconstructSigs package to solve a golden
    ratio search problem for signature fitting.
  + indel_mutation_type:
    - Change default settings for indels. Including variables for context
    and plotting.
  + indel_seq_flanks_start_end:
    - Helper function for 'extract_indels' to get genomic flank information
    of indels.
  + least_squares_error_fitting:
    - Solves the nonnegative least squares error problem for signature
    fitting.
  + mut_occurrences:
    - Replacement of 'mut_96_occurrences', with counting of occurrences
    of all mutation types.
  + mut_strand_occurrences:
    - Replacement of 'mut_192_occurrences' with count of strand occurrences
    of all mutation types.
  + n_bases_mh:
    - Helper function of 'extract_indels' to get the number of bases in
    microhomology around the indel.
  + n_copies_along_flank:
    - Helper function of 'extract_indels' to count the number of times a
    indel is repeated in its flank.
  + plot_profiles:
    - Replacement of 'plot_96_profiles' to plot the profiles of all
    mutation types.
  + plot_strand_profiles:
    - Replacement of 'plot_192_profiles' to plot the strand profiles of all
    mutation types.

* Deprecated functions:
  + mut_192_occurrences
    - Replaced by mut_strand_occurrences
  + mut_96_occurrences
    - Replaced by mut_96_occurrences
  + plot_192_profile
    - Replaced by plot_strand_profiles

  + Return a ggplot object from plot_enrichment_depletion.

* Other:
  + Move gridExtra to suggested packages because it isn't
    used in the code.  The vignette does use it to show
    how plots can be combined into a single figure.

=====================================================

Changes:

* Improvements.
  + Improve error handling with parallel functions.

MutationalPatterns v1.3.1 (Release date: 2017-10-24)
=====================================================

Changes:

* Bugfixes:
  + Fix running of the code examples.


MutationalPatterns v1.3.0 (Release date: 2017-10-22)
=====================================================

Changes:

* Bugfixes:
  + To determine the transcriptional strand of mutations in genes,
    all mutations that overlap with multiple genes were excluded.
    When these genes are on different strands, it can indeed not
    be determined whether a mutation is on the transcribed or
    untransribed strand. However, if these overlapping genes are all
    on the same strand, the transcriptional strand can be determined,
    but these were unneccesarily removed from the analysis.
    This bug is now fixed, and as a result more mutations are now
    included in the analysis.
    This bugfix influences the results of:
    'mut_strand' (previously 'strand_from_vcf') and 'mut_matrix_stranded'

* Renamed functions:
  + 'strand_from_vcf' to 'mut_strand'
  + 'mutation_types' to 'mut_type'
  + 'mutation_context' to 'mut_context'

* New features & parameter changes:
  + Replicative strand bias analyses
    - 'mut_strand' and 'mut_matrix_stranded' can now be executed in two modes:
      'transcription' (default) or 'replication'
    - All downstream analyses can be performed for both modes with
      'strand_occurrences', 'strand_bias_test' and 'plot_strand_bias'
  + Condensed plotting option for 'plot_96_profile' and 'plot_192_profile'
    condensed = F (default), or condensed = T
  + Sample can be hierarchically clustered.

* New functions:
  + 'plot_contribution_heatmap': to visualize the relative contribution of
    mutational signatures in a heatmap. Samples can be hierarchically clustered.
  + 'cos_sim': to calculate the cosine similarity between two vectors.
  + 'cos_sim_matrix': to calculate all pairwise similarities between mutational profiles
  + 'cluster_signatures': to hierarchically cluster signatures based on cosine similarity
  + 'plot_cosine_heatmap': to visualize pairwise cosine similarities between mutational profiles in a heatmap

    It also accepts  the new optional 'check_alleles'
