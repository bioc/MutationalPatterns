#' Find strand of mutations
#' 
#' @details
#' For transcription mode:
#' Definitions of gene bodies with strand (+/-) information should be defined
#' in a GRanges object.
#' 
#' For the base substitutions that are within gene bodies, it is determined whether
#' the "C" or "T" base is on the same strand as the gene definition. (Since
#' by convention we regard base substitutions as C>X or T>X.)
#'
#' Base substitions on the same strand as the gene definitions are considered
#' "untranscribed", and on the opposite strand of gene bodies as "transcribed",
#' since the gene definitions report the coding or sense strand, which is
#' untranscribed.
#'
#' No strand information "-" is returned for base substitutions outside gene
#' bodies, or base substitutions that overlap with more than one gene body on 
#' the same strand.
#' 
#' For replication mode:
#' Replication directions of genomic ranges should be defined in GRanges object.
#' The GRanges object should have a "strand_info" metadata column, 
#' which contains only two different annotations, e.g. "left" and "right", or 
#' "leading" and "lagging". The genomic ranges cannot overlap, to allow only one 
#' annotation per location.
#' 
#' For each base substitution it is determined on which strand it is located.
#' No strand information "-" is returned for base substitutions in unannotated 
#' genomic regions.
#' 
#' With the package we provide an example dataset, see example code.
#' 
#'
#' @param vcf GRanges containing the VCF object
#' @param ranges GRanges object with the genomic ranges of:
#' 1. (transcription mode) the gene bodies with strand (+/-) information, or 
#' 2. (replication mode) the replication strand with 'strand_info' metadata 
#' @param mode "transcription" or "replication", default = "transcription"
#' @param type Optional. Get strand information for 1 or more mutation types.
#' Options are 'snv', 'snv+dbs', 'snv+indel', 'dbs', 'dbs+indel', 'indel' or 'all'
#'
#' @return Character vector with transcriptional strand information with
#' length of vcf: "-" for positions outside gene bodies, "U" for
#' untranscribed/sense/coding strand, "T" for
#' transcribed/anti-sense/non-coding strand.

#' @examples
#' ## For this example we need our variants from the VCF samples, and
#' ## a known genes dataset.  See the 'read_vcfs_as_granges()' example
#' ## for how to load the VCF samples.
#' vcfs <- readRDS(system.file("states/read_vcfs_as_granges_output.rds",
#'                 package="MutationalPatterns"))

#' ## For transcription strand:
#' ## You can obtain the known genes from the UCSC hg19 dataset using
#' ## Bioconductor:
#' # source("https://bioconductor.org/biocLite.R")
#' # biocLite("TxDb.Hsapiens.UCSC.hg19.knownGene")
#' # library("TxDb.Hsapiens.UCSC.hg19.knownGene")
#'
#' ## For this example, we preloaded the data for you:
#' genes_hg19 <- readRDS(system.file("states/genes_hg19.rds",
#'                         package="MutationalPatterns"))
#'
#' mut_strand(vcfs[[1]], genes_hg19, mode = "transcription")
#' 
#' ## For replication strand:
#' ## Read example bed file with replication direction annotation
#' ## Read replistrand data
#' repli_file = system.file("extdata/ReplicationDirectionRegions.bed", 
#'                           package = "MutationalPatterns")
