#' Calculate the number of bases that are homologous to the 3' flanking sequence
#'
#' @description Helper function for extractSigsIndel(). Scans a maximum of 1 indel length from
#' 5' to 3' in the flanking sequence to detect identical bases. Stops prematurely if a
#' non-identical base is found.
#'
#' DSBs can be repaired using 3' microhomology, which can be present relative to either the +
#' or - strand. Therefore, both left and right flanking sequences of the indel need to be
#' considered. When calculating left flanking homology (i.e. homology in the 3' direction for
#' the - strand), the reverse complement of the indel sequence and flanking sequence need to
#' be taken. However, the reverse can be taken for the calculation to save computation.
#'
#' @param indel.seq The indel sequence as a character
#' @param flank.seq The flanking sequence as a character

#' @return An integer stating the number of bases in microhomology
