\arguments{
\item{muttype}{The type of mutations. Possible values:
* 'snv' (default);

* 'tsb_snv' transcription strand bias snv;}

* 'COSMIC' (default);
* 'SIGNAL';
* 'SPARSE';}

* 'reference' (default);

* 'tissue';}

\item{incl_poss_artifacts}{Whether to include possible
artifacts. (default: TRUE)}

\item{tissue_type}{The specific tissue to select signatures from.
Can only be used when looking at tissue specific signatures.
Keep this at NA to see tissue specific signatures for all tissues.}

\value{
A signature matrix
}
\description{
This function loads a signature matrix of pre-defined signatures.
It can retrieve signatures for different types of mutations.
It can also retrieve signatures from different sources.
Additionally, different signature types can be retrieved.
(The possible types are: Reference, tissue specific or drug exposure signatures.)
Finally, the user can choose whether to include possible artifacts.
If no signatures have been defined for a specific combination of options,
then an error is given.
}
\details{
Possible combinations:
COSMIC:
- all muttypes.
- reference
- Can include possible artifacts for SNVs

SIGNAL:
 - SNV. (+ DBS, when using exposure signatures.)
 - all signature types
 - Can include possible artifacts for reference SNVs

SPARSE:
 - SNV
 - reference

 Artifacts can be included when using reference signatures for
 SNVs with COSMIC and SIGNAL


The signatures bundled in this package came from several sources.
Please cite the associated papers if you use them.

The COSMIC signatures were downloaded from:
https://cancer.sanger.ac.uk/cosmic/signatures
We used version 3.1.
Paper:  Alexandrov, L.B. et al., 2020, Nature

The SIGNAL signatures were downloaded from:
https://signal.mutationalsignatures.com/
They were downloaded on: 03 July 2020.
Paper: Andrea Degasperi et al., 2020, Nature Cancer
Exposure paper: Jill E Kucab et al., 2019, Cell

The SPARSE signatures were downloaded from:
https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/384834v2
They were downloaded on: 03 July 2020.
