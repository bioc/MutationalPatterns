\title{Extract mutational signatures from mutation matrix using NMF}
\usage{
extract_signatures(mut_matrix, type, rank, nrun = 200, method = "split")
}
\arguments{
\item{mut_matrix}{Named list with mutation matrix of single or double substitution and/or indels.
Optional to give a matrix object as mutation count matrix. When two mutation types are given in
the same matrix, the data is treated as "combined" and combined signatures will be returned.}

\item{type}{(Optional) A character vector stating which type of mutation is to be extracted:
'snv', 'dbs' and/or 'indel'. All mutation types can also be chosen by 'type = all'.\cr
Default is 'snv'}

\item{rank}{Number of signatures to extract}

\item{nrun}{(Optional) Number of iterations, default = 200}

\item{method}{(Optional) Character stating how to use the data. method = "split" will give
results for each mutation type seperately, whereas method = "combine" will give
combined signatures.\cr
Default is "split"}
}
\value{
Named list of mutation matrix, signatures and signature contribution for
each mutation type (method = "split") or all mutation types together (method = "combine")
}
\description{
Decomposes count matrix of mutation type into signatures and contribution of
those signatures to the spectra of the samples/vcf files.
}
\examples{
## See the 'mut_matrix()' example for how we obtained the mutation matrix:
mut_mat <- readRDS(system.file("states/mut_mat_data.rds",
                    package="MutationalPatterns"))

## This function is computational intensive.
# nmf_res <- extract_signatures(mut_mat, rank = 2)
